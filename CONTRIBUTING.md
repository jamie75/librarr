# Contributing to Librarr

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

cd librarr
go build -o librarr ./cmd/librarr/
go test ./...
```

## Good First Issues

Check the [good first issue](https://github.com/jamie75/librarr/labels/good%20first%20issue) label for beginner-friendly tasks.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`go test ./...`)
5. Commit and push
6. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Table-driven tests with `t.Run()`
- Mock HTTP calls with `httptest.NewServer`
- No external test frameworks — just `testing`

## Adding a Search Source

1. Create `internal/search/yoursource.go` implementing the `Source` interface
2. Add it to the source registry in `internal/search/searcher.go`
3. Add config vars in `internal/config/config.go`
4. Write tests in `internal/search/yoursource_test.go`

## Areas That Need Help

- **Security audit** — review HTTP clients for SSRF/injection (#4)
- **New search sources** — more book/audiobook/manga sources
- **UI improvements** — the web UI is functional but minimal
- **Documentation** — guides for specific setups, migration, OPDS clients, and Docker deployment
